This repository has inspired from `dotfile` to setup a new machine from zero to hero. With dotfile or automation script to sestup a new machine it very useful to save developer time.

By the way, dotfile provide some thing that I don't want to install on my machine, so it would be easilier to manage that I create my own shell to install instead but some command I had an idea from dotfile.

However, if you don't mind about something over install, you might be consider next topic about dotfile recommend.
